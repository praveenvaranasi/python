# create list comprehensions for all these elements:

# For example, this listcomp combines the elements of two lists if they are not equal:

# Have a list. create a new list with the values doubled. Make sure you have some negative values in this list.

# Filter the list to exclude negative numbers

# Apply a function to all the elements in the above list. say reverse the list of elements

# create a list of 2-tuples like (number, square)
